Hey there, my name's Sam and I'm a Software Engineer from the UK. I started my coding journey in 2013 after dropping out of a course called "Zoology" at LJMU, to study "Computing and Website Development" at the University of Bolton.

## My Background

I've been in professional coding jobs since graduating from Uni in 2016. At the time of writing this post, I've worked for [Suresite](https://www.suresite.co.uk/), [Sizzle Creative](https://www.sizzlecreative.co.uk/) and [On the Beach](https://onthebeach.co.uk/) (where I currently work).

Currently, I focus on building web applications with NextJs, React and TypeScript. But I also like to tinker with building APIs and backends in my free time.

Since starting my journey, I've gained experience across most aspects of the application lifecycle, including frontend, backend, and agile ways of working.

## The Future of this Site

I love learning and sharing knowledge and I wanted a place to document the things I'm learning (outside of Notion). So expect to see lots more blog posts in the near future.
