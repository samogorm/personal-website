# 🧑‍💻 Personal Website

Hey there, this repo contains my personal website which you can visit here: [samogorman.uk](https://www.samogorman.uk/).

## 💪🏻 Motivations

I wanted a minimal website that's easy to maintain. My old website was built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and used [Prismic](https://prismic.io/) as the CMS, which are both awesome.

However, it was *over-engineered* for what I needed from it.

This new site strips back the complexity and now it only contains a mixture of static/mdx content:

- Some brief text on who I am and what I do
- My blog posts (not that many right now, but keep your eyes peeled!)


## 💻 Tech Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [ZOD](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)

## 🔮 Future Iterations

Here's a list of things I'm thinking of doing in future:

- A dedicated blog page
- Filter, search and paginate blog posts


## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |

## 🪙 Credit

I'm new to Astro and I wanted to get this up and running pretty quickly, so I used the "blog" template from the Astro docs.
